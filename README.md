```
This code allows you to find the restaurants with both mentions "bib" and "maitrerestaurateur" around you.

Here we chose Paris as a center in our code since many prestigious restaurants are there.

You can see that in the get_restaurant function : the "center" values represents the latitude and longitude of the wanted city, here it is Paris.

The maximum distance you can check restaurants for around Paris is 200 km thus the dist: 200000.

Also, the authKey is provided when you create an account on Michelin and allows you to use their apis for a month freely.

Bon appetit !
